# I am learning a lot of things while working on this basic project.

    1. I learnt how to format my HTML code to be more readable. I don't always have to enclose the text in it's own line. For example:
        Using <title>Page Title</title>
        Rather than: <title>
                        Page Title
                     </title>
    2. I learnt that I can add comments to remember to do stuff in my program or comments for other programmers.
    3. I realised that I can use a README.md file to document stuff I learn along the way which is helpful for myself and others.
    4. I realised that adding all the HTML elements before styling them makes life a lot easier!
    5. Doing everything in VS Code simplifies my workflow a lot. Maybe when I learn a framework it will be even easier.
    6. The description comes under the title in a page's search result. It looks nice when wriiten under the title in the code.
    7. Use button role even on simple buttons.
    8. Only use the heading element when making a page title, section title, or article title. Do not use it for album title etc. Remember that it has semantic meaning. Use a div instead.
    9. If stuff is inline, use a span rather than a div unless it contains many pther elements.
    10. Always add an alt tag to images when I put them on the website. This allows them to show up even before I add the source.
    11. Always change the file extension of webmp or jpg/jpeg to png.
    12. It's okay to style images with width and height in HTML before using CSS.

<!-- I'd say 12. applies to more than one stuff too. For example, using divs to add elements to their own line rather than styling it as a block element. -->
