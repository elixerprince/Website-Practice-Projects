# I am learning  lot of things while working on this basic project.
    # I learnt how to format my HTML code to be more readable. I don't always have to enclose the text in it's own line. For examle: 
        Using <title>Page Title</title>
        Rather than: <title>
                        Page Title
                     </title>
    # I learnt that I can add comments to remember to do stuff in my program or comments for other programmers.
    # I realised that I can use a README file to document stuff I learn along the way which is helpful for myself and others.
    # I realised that adding all the HTML elements before styling them makes life a lot easier!
    # Doing everything in VS Code simplifies my workflow a lot. Maybe when I learn a framework it will be even easier.
