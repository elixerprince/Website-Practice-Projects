# This site will allow me to learn how to create different types of forms.
    1. In a form, the get method appends to the url while submitting but the post method submits to a server and will give an error if you dont have one specified.
    2. With Github Copilot and Emit you can type ! and hit enter to quickly generate all the necessary tags needed for every page.
    3. Forms should always have an action to specify where info should be posted. Use get to post to a results page when testing but use post when submitting to a server.
    <!-- GET appends sensitive information to the url so don't use it on an actual site -->
    4. Name allows the info entered to be proccesed by a server while id allows <label> to recognise the input field being refered to. It's also useful for screen readers and people with a disability.
    5. Value can be used to set a default value while placeholder sets a placeholder text that disappears when you type.
    6. Checkbox allows for multiple selection while radio button only allows one.
