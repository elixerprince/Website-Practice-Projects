# This site will allow me to learn how to create different types of forms.
    1. In a form, the get method appends to the url while submitting but the post method submits to a server and will give an error if you dont have one specified.
    2. With Emet you can type ! and hit enter to quickly generate all the necessary tags needed for every page.
    3. Forms should always have an action to specify where info should be posted. Use get to post to a results page when testing but use post when submitting to a server.
    <!-- GET appends sensitive information to the url so don't use it on an actual site -->
    4. Name allows the info entered to be proccesed by a server while id allows <label> to recognise the input field being refered to. It's also useful for screen readers and people with a disability.
    5. Value can be used to set a default value while placeholder sets a placeholder text that disappears when you type.
    6. Checkbox allows for multiple selection while radio button only allows one.
    7. Always add radio values so the submit page knows what is being selected.
    8. By default a select element only allows a single selection but the multiple attribute allows multiple selection.
    9. enctype="multipart/form-data" goes inside the form tag and it allows files to be used by a server.
    10. The two anomaly elements in a form that are not inputs are select and textarea.

    # Two things I'm constantly struggling to remember are enctype and role (This one took me multiple days)
    # I just found out that Emet is actually inbuilt in VS Code and that's why it automatically finishes our tags etc.
